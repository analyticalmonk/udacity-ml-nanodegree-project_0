# Titanic Survival Exploration
## Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree: Project 0

In this optional project, I manually created decision functions that attempt to
predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s
features, such as sex and age. We start out with a simple algorithm and increase
 its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least
 80% of the passengers in the provided data.
